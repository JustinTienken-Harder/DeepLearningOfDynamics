WARNING:

Code will not be executable from this alone. Must clean up the TODOs.

Provides a backbone for the training method on a deep policy network.

Presumably, the input to the network will be images as the current state (including current resource usage, and random M jobs to schedule).
The output predictions are the probabilities for choosing to schedule one of the M jobs.

Most important is the train_on_jobs method for updating the weights of the network, in accordance with DPN loss functions.
